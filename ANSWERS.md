**1.** Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that is able to execute JavaScript code server-side. This is different than the typical use of JavaScript which included client-side scripting in which the JavaScript is run in the client's web browser. With Node.js, the code is run before the page is sent to the user's browser.

**2.** Express is a web framework for Node.js. It helps us organize our web application into an MVC architecture on the server side. It also provides mechanisms that allow us to write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different routes, set settings like the port to use for connecting and the location of templates that will later render a response, and it also allows us to add the additional request processing "middleware" at any point within the request.

**3.** Middleware is a function that is executed after the input/source and then produces an output which can either be the final output or be used by the next middleware.
 
**4.** An endpoint is one end of a communication channel. This will usually be represented as the URL of a server or service.
